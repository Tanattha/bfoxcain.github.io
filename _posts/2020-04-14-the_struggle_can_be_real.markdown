My biggest struggle was with `yield`. With my Leader's help I figured it out and was able to understand it's usage. 
I see it as more like a crossing guard for code. `yield` stops the method's flow... inserts a method or value within the yielded method.... then picks-up up the orginal method's flow. 

Other ethen that I have not struggled with anything other then stinking syntax errors mainly because I have an `end` missing or in the wrong place.
