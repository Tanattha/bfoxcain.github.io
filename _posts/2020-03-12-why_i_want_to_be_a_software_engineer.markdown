I have a bit of technical background that is self taught. I have also been a stay at home mom for the past 13 years. With the support and push from my best friend I started looking at building websites again for clients. I had another friend introduce me to the idea of Flatiron and the ISA program for funding help. Once I realized I really would like to do Software coding I started researching it. I then figured why not and jumped at this oppurtunity.
